Machine Learning Fundamentals
=============================

Machine learning is a subset of artificial intelligence (AI) that enables computers to learn and make decisions from data without being explicitly programmed for every task.

Key Types of Machine Learning:
1. Supervised Learning: Uses labeled data to train models (e.g., classification, regression)
2. Unsupervised Learning: Finds patterns in unlabeled data (e.g., clustering, dimensionality reduction)
3. Reinforcement Learning: Learns through interaction with environment using rewards and penalties

Common Applications:
- Image and speech recognition
- Natural language processing
- Recommendation systems
- Autonomous vehicles
- Medical diagnosis
- Financial fraud detection

# Natural Language Processing (NLP)

Natural Language Processing is a branch of artificial intelligence that helps computers understand, interpret, and manipulate human language.

## Key NLP Tasks:
- **Text Classification**: Categorizing text into predefined classes
- **Sentiment Analysis**: Determining emotional tone of text
- **Named Entity Recognition**: Identifying entities like names, locations, organizations
- **Machine Translation**: Converting text from one language to another
- **Question Answering**: Providing relevant answers to user questions
- **Text Summarization**: Creating concise summaries of longer texts

## NLP Techniques:
- Tokenization: Breaking text into individual words or tokens
- Part-of-speech tagging: Identifying grammatical roles of words
- Dependency parsing: Understanding grammatical relationships
- Word embeddings: Converting words to numerical vectors
- Transformer models: Advanced neural networks for language understanding

## Popular NLP Libraries:
- NLTK, spaCy, Transformers, Gensim

# Document 3: Vector Embeddings and Search (TXT)
cat <<EOT > $INPUT_DOCS_DIR/vector_embeddings_search.txt
Vector Embeddings and Similarity Search
======================================

Vector embeddings are numerical representations of text, images, or other data in high-dimensional space. They capture semantic meaning and enable similarity comparisons.

How Vector Embeddings Work:
- Convert text/data into dense numerical vectors
- Similar items have vectors close to each other in vector space
- Enable semantic search beyond keyword matching

Similarity Search Methods:
1. Cosine Similarity: Measures angle between vectors
2. Euclidean Distance: Straight-line distance between points
3. Dot Product: Mathematical operation for similarity

Applications:
- Semantic search in documents
- Recommendation systems
- Image similarity search
- Clustering similar items
- Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)

Popular Vector Databases:
- Pinecone, Weaviate, Qdrant, pgvector, Chroma

# FastAPI and Python Development Guide

## What is FastAPI?
FastAPI is a modern, fast web framework for building APIs with Python based on standard Python type hints.

### Key FastAPI Features:
- **High Performance**: One of the fastest Python frameworks available
- **Easy to Use**: Intuitive design based on Python type hints
- **Automatic Documentation**: Interactive API docs with Swagger UI
- **Standards-based**: Based on OpenAPI and JSON Schema
- **Production Ready**: Used by companies like Netflix, Uber, Microsoft

### FastAPI Benefits:
- Fast development and deployment
- Automatic request/response validation
- Built-in security features
- Async/await support for high concurrency
- Excellent editor support with autocompletion

## Python in AI/ML:
Python is the dominant language for artificial intelligence and machine learning due to:
- Rich ecosystem of libraries (NumPy, Pandas, Scikit-learn, TensorFlow, PyTorch)
- Simple and readable syntax
- Strong community support
- Excellent for prototyping and production
- Integration with data science tools
